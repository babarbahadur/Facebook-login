Install React Native Linkedin
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-linkedin

Since WebView has been removed from React native therefore we have to install it from 
https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview

After installing it go to the node modules/react-native-linkedin/index and import
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

Now your package will be working fine now go to your app.js file

Then Go to https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps
Create a new app and fill in the required data then you will get clientID and clientSecret  which you have to copy in the
LinkedinModal as mentioned below..

import LinkedInModal from 'react-native-linkedin'

	<View>
        <LinkedInModal
          clientID="86li8a5icdlteg"
          clientSecret="41v6apmBGDnW7tI6"
          redirectUri="https://www.google.com"
          onSuccess={token => console.log(token)}
        />
        </View>
